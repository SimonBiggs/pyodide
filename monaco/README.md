## Monaco Editor with Pyodide / Python Language Server support

This example demonstrates setting up the [Python Language Server](https://github.com/palantir/python-language-server) to run on Pyodide in a WebWorker powering Python language support for the Monaco editor.

To run the demo ensure you have yarn installed (`npm install yarn`), build Pyodide as described, then run from the command line:

```bash
cd monaco
yarn run serve
```

The demo will then be hosted at https://localhost:8080
